Take-home assessment for Flutter - Currently in progress. I chose to create an app where you can debate any topic within reason with a chatbot, or just watch a chatbot debate another chatbot.

## Instructions

1. Create a .env, fill in with your Google Gemini key ```GEMINI_API_KEY = your_api_key```
2. Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed.
3. Run ```npm run inst && npm run start```
4. Open the frontend URL provided in the terminal
5. Done
