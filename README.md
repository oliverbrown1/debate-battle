## Overview

Take-home assessment for Flutter. I chose to create an app where you can debate any topic within reason with a chatbot, or just watch a chatbot debate another chatbot. The rules for this assignment was to create something cool using a Gemini API key. The stack for this project uses Express.js + Node.js for the backend, and React.js for the frontend.

## Features

* Debate against Gemini 2.5 Flash directed using prompt engineering techniques including few-shot prompts.
* Have 2 Flash models debate against each other, useful for learning the upsides and downsides of a topic/argument
* Have multiple models debate against each other -> a full on debate
* chat colours to easily identify which agent is responding

## Instructions

1. Create a .env, fill in with your Google Gemini key ```GEMINI_API_KEY = your_api_key```
2. Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed.
3. Run ```npm run inst && npm run start```
4. Open the frontend URL provided in the terminal
5. Done
